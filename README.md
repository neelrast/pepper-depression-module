This repository is for Pepper/Nao Applications to have lexical conversations and do named entity recognition for easier dialog management.

## CLTL/Pepper Features
 - A Platform-Agnostic, Object-Oriented Framework for creating Robot Applications
 - The necessary Machine Learning algos implemented as class functions for enabling Human-Robot conversation
 - Language Understanding through Grammars and Lexicals
 - Knowledge Representation of Learned Facts through RDF Graph
 - Realtime visualisation in web browser (WIP)

To get started check `apps\example` & `apps\test` folder to see how to play with CLTL API and develop your own dialog system over Pepper's NaoQi App.

Please Note: This project is adapted from VU Amsterdam - CLTL Project which was created to provide multimodal communication with knowledge graphs for pepper to enable easier knowledge update and represnetation.
